# Online Clearance System

This is an online clearance system that was created using Flask, a Python web framework. The system is designed to help students get clearance before graduating. The website serves as a portal where students can request clearance before graduating. The relevant staff members can approve the clearance requests before students receive the clearance statement which is required to collect their final results.
